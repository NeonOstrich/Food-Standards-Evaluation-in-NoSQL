# Food-Standards-Evaluation-in-NoSQL

##Background 
This is a team assignment that was completed for the George Washington University Data Analytics Bootcamp, focused on NoSQL, MongoDB, Jupyter Notebook, loading a database, and Exploratory Analysis.

##Organization 
Inside of this repository, you will find this readme file, in addition to two Jupyter Notebook files and two folders. The first Jupyter Notebook file is named NoSQL_setup and contains the code to load a JSON file as well as adding to its content and confirming certain information. The second Jupyter Notebook file is named NoSQL_analysis and contains analysis of the database previously created. The Resources folder holds establisments.json file which is the source of the data which is loaded into the database we are using. And finally the screenshots folder contains the screenshots that can be viewed below.

##Description 
In the setup file, we loaded the database using MongoDB and PyMongo. We then loaded additional information into the database and finally confirmed the information.
In our analysis we focused on answering specific questions:

Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?

Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?

What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of '5', sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?

How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
